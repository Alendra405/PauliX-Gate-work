# PauliX-Gate-work
In this section, we implemented the Pauli X gate on qubit 1 using the qiskit library.

# What does Pauly X do?
Pauli X is a unitary matrix gate for quantum computers that inverts the state of a qubit on a Bloch sphere with the x-axis.

# Who am I?
I am Arman Badpa! While sharing this project, I am 15 years old and I am aware of the low quality and low level of this project. In the future, I will raise and strengthen the level of shared projects.
